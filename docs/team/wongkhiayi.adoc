== PROJECT: Catalogue

---

== Overview

* This is a desktop Catalogue application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for librarians, students and guests using the library.
* We started the project based on an AddressBook sample application(https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level4) that is around 10KLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the model for catalogue for books and its relevant tests in command, model, system and xml.
** What it does: Allows the app to store books.
** Justification: This makes the program relevant to our project and rejects invalid inputs to keep the Catalogue clean.
** Highlights: This enhancement is related to all components of the program including the data files and tests, it required a careful analysis of the whole system before it is implemented.

* *Minor enhancement*: Updated message outputs and sample data.
